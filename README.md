# Jober-Android-App

## Why
More and more people worldwide are looking for a job and job-search apps are spreading. However, just a few of them allow to manage the entire end-to-end process (job search, application, contacts & chats, agenda, interviews, profile creation) within a single mobile-app. Jober is one of them!

##What
Jober is a search-job android application developed in Kotlin within Android Studio. It is completeley open-source and released under the LICENSE file conditions.

## What a user can do
A user can decide to register and create a profile as a "Worker" (term used to refer to those looking for a job) or a "Company" (term used to refer to those representing companies and posting job offers online). In any case, the profile is editable.
A user registered as Company can post job offers, view those who have applied to them, contact them through a built-in chat and set up interviews thanks to the built-in agenda. A user playing this role can also view other companies job offers.
A user registered as Worker can view available job offers online, apply to some of them and wait to be contacted by some companies interested in him. He can then take part to interviews and schedule them in the built-in agenda
