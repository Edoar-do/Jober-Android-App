GIORGIO PANINO
	
Giorgio is a soon to be Engineer, he is attending the last year of his studies and is about to enter the business world. Unfortunately he does not have any experience in contacting companies to ask if they are looking for someone. Moreover, he is quite shy and would love to see and consider many job offers with ease and without having to send emails directly to the companies. He is very good with technology, so he searches on the play store for an app to help him find the job of his dreams. After reading some reviews, he decides to download Jober, which has apparently all the features Giorgio is interested in. He registers in the app, adds some information about himself and starts looking at all the latest job offers posted by the companies he is interested in. In the app he is able to filter the offers based on the his location of preference, position and company. After about half an hour he finds three job offers that inspire him, so he decides to apply to them. The day after, two of the companies contact him through the in-app chat and ask him if he is available for an interview to test if he could really fit the position. In the following weeks he continues to have these interactions with other companies and can easely keep track of all the meetings thanks to the built-in calendar.
