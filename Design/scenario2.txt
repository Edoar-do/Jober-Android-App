SARA ALFIERI
Sara is a 45 years old HR specialist, born in Mantova and currently working in Milan. The worst part of her job consists in looking through hundreds of CVs sent her by people looking for a job in her company. Her company is still posting available positions on the company website and asks the people interested in the jobs to send a presentation email to an account managed by Sara. Tired of this way of working, Sara decides to test a new application named Jober, which promises companies to manage all the offers and relative applicants in a easy and intuitive way. After the initial registration of the company profile, Sara enters some information about it and creates a first offer filling fields such as the position, the location, the required skills and languages. After two hours, she logs in the app and finds out that 20 people have already applied to the offer. Through the "Applicants" page of the app, Sara manages to see all the people that have applied to the offer, and is able to check out their profile just by tapping on their name.
5 of the 20 people look very interesting to her and she decides to contact them. She is happy to see that she does not have to write a formal email or contact them via phone, but she can write them a simple message in the built-in chat. In the following days she sets up a lot of interviews with a selection of people. Satified about the experience with Jober, Sara decides to post all the company offers. A page in the app allows her to see all the offers she posted, to manage all the conversations with the applicants as well as all the future interviews. She is happy to have found a new way of doing the most boring part of her job.
